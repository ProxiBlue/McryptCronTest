ProxiBlue McryptCronTest Extension
=====================

This is a test case module to test an issue I found on magemojo hosting.
This module will confirm the issue exists on multiple instances, not just once.

To Install via Composer:

```
"require": {
           "proxiblue/mcryptcrontest":"*"
      },
   "repositories": [
      {
            "type": "vcs",
                "url": "https://github.com/ProxiBlue/McryptCronTest.git"
        }
    ],
```
